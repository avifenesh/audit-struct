# Task Breakdown Recommendation for Solo Side Project

## Context
- **Solo developer** - No team collaboration needed
- **Side project** - No strict timeline, work at your own pace
- **Focus**: Actionable tasks with code examples, not PM overhead

---

## Best Version: **docs/11-task-breakdown.md** (Version 1)

### Why It's Best for Solo Work

1. ✅ **Most actionable** - Code examples and file structures included
2. ✅ **Clear implementation steps** - You know exactly what to build
3. ✅ **No PM overhead** - No complex dependencies or time estimates
4. ✅ **Easy to track** - Simple checkbox format
5. ✅ **Incremental** - Can pick up any task and work on it

### What to Keep

- ✅ All code examples and file structures
- ✅ Step-by-step task breakdown
- ✅ CLI command examples
- ✅ Checkbox tracking format
- ✅ Implementation details

### What to Change

1. **Remove week-by-week timeline**
   - Replace with priority-based ordering
   - P0 = MVP must-haves
   - P1 = Nice to have
   - P2 = Future/optional

2. **Add Phase 4 tasks** (from Version 2)
   - Mark as P2/optional
   - False sharing detection
   - Optimization suggestions
   - Go language support
   - LTO insights

3. **Simplify structure**
   - Remove complex dependencies (you'll know what to do next)
   - Remove time estimates (work at your own pace)
   - Keep it simple and actionable

4. **Add "Quick Wins" section**
   - Tasks that take 1-2 hours
   - Good for limited time sessions
   - Builds momentum

## Recommended Structure

```
# Task Breakdown (Solo Project)

## Priority Guide
- **P0**: MVP must-haves (build first)
- **P1**: Nice to have (after MVP)
- **P2**: Future/optional (can skip)

## Quick Wins (1-2 hours each)
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
...

## Phase 1: Core CLI (P0)
### Project Setup
- [ ] Task with code example
...

## Phase 2: Advanced Features (P1)
...

## Phase 3: SaaS Platform (P1)
...

## Phase 4: Advanced Capabilities (P2 - Optional)
...
```

---

## What to Skip

### From Version 3 (Epic/Task Format)
- ❌ Complex task dependencies - You'll know what to do next
- ❌ Time estimates - Work at your own pace
- ❌ Strict Epic/Task structure - Overkill for solo work
- ❌ Acceptance criteria - You know when it's done

### From All Versions
- ❌ Week-by-week timeline - No deadline pressure
- ❌ Team coordination - Not needed
- ❌ Business/GTM tasks - Optional for side project
- ❌ Strict release dates - Release when ready

---

## Focus Areas for Solo Project

### Must Have (P0)
1. **Core CLI** - Basic inspection working
2. **DWARF parsing** - Handle common cases
3. **Output formatting** - Table and JSON
4. **Basic testing** - Make sure it works

### Nice to Have (P1)
1. **Diff functionality** - Compare layouts
2. **CI mode** - Budget checking
3. **Advanced DWARF** - Bitfields, expressions
4. **SaaS platform** - If you want to monetize

### Optional (P2)
1. **Phase 4 features** - Advanced capabilities
2. **Business tasks** - Marketing, sales
3. **IDE plugins** - Future enhancement
4. **Go language support** - Expand scope

---

## Workflow Recommendations

1. **Start with Quick Wins**
   - Build momentum with small tasks
   - Get something working quickly

2. **Focus on P0 tasks first**
   - Get MVP working end-to-end
   - Don't get distracted by P1/P2

3. **Iterate incrementally**
   - Complete one feature fully before moving on
   - Test as you go

4. **Skip what you don't need**
   - Business tasks? Skip if not monetizing
   - Advanced features? Add later if needed
   - Documentation? Write as you go

---

## Missing Items to Add

### Technical (Add to appropriate phase)
- [ ] Testing strategy (but keep it simple)
- [ ] Basic security review (before SaaS)
- [ ] Documentation (as you build)

### Optional
- [ ] Phase 4 features (from Version 2)
- [ ] Business tasks (only if monetizing)

---

## Summary

**Use Version 1 as your base** because:
- Most actionable for solo development
- Code examples help you get started
- No unnecessary PM structure
- Easy to track progress

**Enhance it with:**
- Priority markers (P0/P1/P2)
- Phase 4 tasks (marked optional)
- Quick wins section
- Remove timeline pressure

**Skip:**
- Complex dependencies
- Time estimates
- Team coordination
- Strict structure

**Remember:** This is a side project. Build what's fun and useful. You can always add more later.
